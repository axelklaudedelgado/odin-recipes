        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sisig (SEE-sig) is traditionally made with chopped pig's face and served on a sizzling hot platter. The mushrooms here mimic the chewy-meaty quality of pork and don't take nearly as long to prepare. You still get all the salty, tangy, and spicy flavors. And no face gets chopped!</p>
