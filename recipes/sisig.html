        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sisig (SEE-sig) is traditionally made with chopped pig's face and served on a sizzling hot platter. The mushrooms here mimic the chewy-meaty quality of pork and don't take nearly as long to prepare. You still get all the salty, tangy, and spicy flavors. And no face gets chopped!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup chopped red onion</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 green onions, white parts chopped and green parts thinly bias-sliced</li>
            <li>4 Thai chile peppers, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh oyster mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup calamansi (Philippine lime) juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and white parts of green onions; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in chiles and mushrooms; cook, stirring, until tender and excess liquid evaporates, 5 to 8 minutes. Add soy sauce and calamansi juice; cook, stirring, until reduced to a glaze consistency, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and add more soy sauce or calamansi juice to reach desired tanginess and saltiness.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with a dollop of avocado oil mayonnaise and a sprinkle of the green parts of green onions.</li>
        </ol>
